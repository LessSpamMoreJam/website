# Origin Story...

When trying to search for quick recipies online we were constantly faced an abusive level of pop-ups, adverts and spammy websites.
After scrolling through pages and pages of tragic back story to every single ingredient, we could finally get to a list of ingredients, and maybe find the method of how to cook.

This website aims to solve this problem. 

Simple website. Each recipe contains two part. Ingredients and Method.

That is all!




Hate spammy websites, but want the recipes?  Us too.

Don’t care about their tragic backstory? Us neither.

Hate 10 million pop-ups and endless scrolling to see ingredient? Holla!


Scroll on to get fuss free recipes to try.  Life’s too short; forget the Spam, add more Jam.


All of our recipes have been tried and tested on multiple occasions, so we’re sure they‘ll work for you.
