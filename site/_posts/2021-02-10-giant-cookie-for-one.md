For when you want to have a cookie all for yourself!

# Ingredients

* 2 tbsp/30g butter
* 3 tbsp/40g packed light brown sugar
* Pinch of salt
* 1 tbsp whisked egg - I know..but just make this recipe when you want to have scrambled eggs that day.  You can always save the rest of the egg for later on.
* Capful of vanilla extract
* ⅓ cup/40g plain flour
* Pinch of baking soda
* 4 tbsp/ ½ bag of chocolate chips - can substitute for M&Ms, Minstrels, Smarties etc. I add loads so this is a very loose figure.

# Method

1. Preheat oven to 350F/180C non fan/160C fan assisted. Line a baking sheet with parchment/non-stick sheet.
2. Microwave butter for 30 secs to melt
3. Add everything else.
4. Mix to make a dough.
5. Place it on a lined sheet
6. Bake for 12-15 minutes.
7. Enjoy.
